# Tableau
Tableau projects that I have made. 

1. Gapminder: This is a recreation of Hans Rosling's famous scatterplot from his Ted Talk on statistics and data visualization. The scatterplot shows life expectancy and fertility rate, sized by population. The visualisation should also automatically page through the years. 

2. Sales Order Data: Four years (2016-2019) of Global Sales Order Data is given. The following is data is represented:
- Overall Sales Seasonability 
- Sales and Profit for Every Country
- Sales and Profit per Category and Sub-Category
- Average Profit vs Discount per Category
